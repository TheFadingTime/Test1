# Vampire Shooter Mod

## Overview

The Vampire Shooter mod gives your character a cool passive ability that automatically launches fireballs at enemies. Every 10 seconds, three blazing fireballs shoot out in a spread pattern, dealing damage and setting mobs on fire. It's like having a magical vampire guardian watching your back!

## Features

- **Automatic Fireball Barrage**: Every 10 seconds, your character automatically fires three fireballs
- **Triangular Spread Pattern**: Fireballs shoot in three directions - straight ahead, angled left, and angled right for maximum coverage
- **Burning Damage**: Fireballs deal medium damage and set mobs on fire upon impact
- **Always Active**: Works automatically as soon as you join the world - no commands or items needed
- **Visual Effects**: Classic fireball projectiles with full particle and sound effects

## How to Use

1. **Join the Server**: Simply connect to the Hytale server running this mod
2. **Play Normally**: The mod activates automatically - there's nothing to equip or activate
3. **Watch the Fireworks**: Every 10 seconds, you'll see three fireballs shoot out from your character in a triangular spread pattern
4. **Combat Help**: The fireballs will damage any mobs they hit and set them on fire, helping you in combat

That's it! No commands, no special items, no configuration needed. Just play and enjoy the automatic fireball defense system.

## Tips & Tricks

- **Aim Awareness**: The fireballs fire based on where you're looking, so face toward enemies to hit them
- **Spread Coverage**: The triangular spread is great for hitting groups of mobs - try to position yourself so enemies are in front of you
- **Timing**: Remember the 10-second cooldown - if you miss with the current volley, another one is coming soon
- **Safe Distance**: Fireballs spawn slightly in front of you, so they won't hit things right next to your face

## Known Limitations

- Fireballs use the vanilla fireball projectile type and may not be customizable without additional configuration
- The mod applies to all players automatically with no way to toggle it off currently
